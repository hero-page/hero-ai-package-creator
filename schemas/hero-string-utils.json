{"packages":[{"name":"hero-string-utils","description":"A set of utility functions for manipulating strings, such as converting to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalizing the first letter of each word.","functions":[{"function_name":"capitalizeWords","function_summary":"This function capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string. It takes a single input parameter, which is the string to be modified. It should handle cases with different character sets, such as letters with diacritical marks, and ignore words that are already capitalized. Whitespace should be preserved, and it should not modify any special characters or digits. Example: capitalizeWords('hello, world! how are you today?') should return 'Hello, World! How Are You Today?'. The function should gracefully return the original string if it encounters an invalid input (e.g., non-string, empty string, or containing non-text characters)."}]}]}
