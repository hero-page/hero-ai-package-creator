{"packages":[{"name":"hero-array-manipulation","description":"A collection of functions for manipulating arrays, such as sorting, filtering, mapping, and reducing.","functions":[{"function_name":"filterBy","function_summary":"Filter an array of objects based on key and value. The function is case-insensitive and works for arrays with objects that have nested keys. Test cases should include arrays with different object types, nested keys, and non-string values. Extreme cases: long arrays, large objects, deep nesting. Ignore cases with non-array input, non-object elements in arrays, and non-existing keys."},{"function_name":"sortArrayOfObjects","function_summary":"Sort an array of objects based on a key and a sorting order. The function is case-sensitive, provides ascending and descending order options, and works for arrays with objects that have nested keys. Test cases should include arrays with different object types, nested keys, and non-string values for sorting. Extreme cases should handle long arrays, large objects, deep nesting. Ignore cases with non-array input, non-object elements in arrays, and non-existing keys."},{"function_name":"reduceByKey","function_summary":"Group elements of an array (of objects) by a key and apply a reduce function to each group (e.g. count, sum, average, etc.). The function should work for arrays with objects containing nested keys. Test cases should include arrays with different object types, nested keys, and various reduce functions. Extreme cases should handle long arrays, large objects, deep nesting, and complex reduce functions. Ignore cases with non-array input, non-object elements in arrays, and non-existing keys."}]}]}
